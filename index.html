    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        I have deep interest in semiconductor electronics and computer science.
      </li>
      <li>
        I love writing code in C/C++ and I swear by their standard libraries.
      </li>
      <li>I am fluent in Python and Java.</li>
      <li>Routinely, I write Javascript, obviously for web programming.</li>
      <li>
        My favorite algorithm is the RSA cryptographic encryption algorithm.
      </li>
      <li>I am a Unix guy at heart - <b>Linux and MacOS</b>.</li>
      <li>
        I am strongly for the obliteration of the Windows operating system.
      </li>
      <li>
        I do most of my development in Linux primarily Ubuntu alongside the
        Gnome desktop environment.
      </li>
      <li>I am quite-versed with Computer Vision, NLP and other state-of-the-art machine learning technologies - Transformers, LSTMs, LLMs.</li>
      <li>I recently picked up AWS cloud computing; the shege too much but no going back.</li>
      <li>
        I am staunchly for the jetissoning of all web frontend frameworks. We
        are better off writing vanilla javascript and decreasing time to first
        paint. <b>/s</b>
      </li>
      <li>I identify as a follower of the old ways.</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of social media.</li>
      <li>
        I am always up for a good intellectually stimulating conversation with
        someone who can match my intellect. I don't mean this in a rude way.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have been a chess player for one year short of a decade but I don't
        think I ever really got good at it; just plain-ass average.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am very likely to defeat you in a game of chess still. Apologies and
        no apologies.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am a firm proponent of human freedom, libertarianism and social
        democracy.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am all for an egalitarian society and the abrogation of social
        hierachies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Nowadays, I deal with fun things like system architecture, networking,
        deep neural networks, compiler construction and operating system design.
      </li>
      <li>Feel free to leave me a message if you need help with anything.</li>
