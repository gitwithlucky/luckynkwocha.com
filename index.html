    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        I am always up for a good intellectually stimulating conversation with
        someone who can match my intellect. I don't mean this in a rude way.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have been a chess player for about a decade but I don't
        think I ever really got good at it; just plain-ass average.
      </li>
      <li>
        Nevertheless, I am still very likely to beat you in a game of chess still. Apologies and
        no apologies.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am a firm proponent of human freedom and social
        democracy.
      </li>
      <li>Feel free to leave me a message if you need help with anything.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>More..</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        I do a lot of recreational reading because I am interested in knowing a
        lot of stuff.
      </li>
      <li>I conciously make efforts to improve my English vocab.</li>
      <li>I recently picked up French and Spanish. Don't ask me why.</li>
      <li>
        I read a lot. I have a somewhat utopian dream to spend a huge chunk of
        my life reading.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am always looking for new challenges and interesting stuff to keep me
        occupied.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can find me lurking around intelligent spaces like Quora and Reddit.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>I have a lot of hobbies but not a lot of free time</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        I enjoy teaching if my student is interested in learning, otherwise; I
        will take a solid pass.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are a plethora of places I would love to travel to but I currently
        cannot afford them. Working on changing that soon.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have any question, offer or opportunity that could make my life more interesting, get in touch with me via
        <a href="mailto:luckyikenkwocha@gmail.com">email</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the reason stated above, I will only respond to those proposals
        that are a good match for my schedule and interests.
      </li>

      <li>
        I have both WhatsApp and X. If you know me personally, we probably
        already connected on WhatsApp. If not, here is my
        <a href="https://x.com/lucky_nkwocha">X profile</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        I do have a
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucky-nkwocha"
          >linkedin</a
        >
        but I never share my thoughts there.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have a poorly written <a href="./blog.html">blog</a> but I have been
        very lazy to put it in order.
      </li>
    </ul>
