    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        I have deep interest in semicondutor electronics and computer science.
      </li>
      <li>
        I love writing code in C/C++ and I swear by their standard libraries.
      </li>
      <li>I am fluent in Python and Java.</li>
      <li>Routinely, I write Javascript, obviously for web programming.</li>
      <li>
        My favorite algorithm is the RSA cryptographic encryption algorithm.
      </li>
      <li>My primary shell is bash.</li>
      <li>My text editor is Vim.</li>
      <li>I am all for the obliteration of the Windows operating system.</li>
      <li>
        I do most of my development in Linux primarily Ubuntu with Gnome DE.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am strongly for the jetissoning of all frontend frameworks. We are
        better off writing vanilla javascript and decreasing time to first
        paint.
      </li>
      <li>I identify as a follower of the old ways.</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of social media.</li>
      <li>
        I am always up for a good intellectually stimulating conversation with
        someone who can match my intellect.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have been a chess player for a year short of a decade but I don't
        think I ever got good at it.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am most likely to defeat you in a game of chess still. Apologies and
        no apologies.
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm always looking for new challenges and interesting stuff to keep me
        occupied.
      </li>
      <li>I am a firm proponent of liberalism and social democracy.</li>
      <li>
        I am all for an egalitarian society and the abrogation of social
        hierachies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Nowadays, I deal with fun things like system architecture, networking,
        deep neural networks, compiler construction and operating system design.
      </li>
      <li>Feel free to send me a message if you need help with anything.</li>
